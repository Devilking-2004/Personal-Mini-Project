# Personal-Mini-Project

# 1. IOT based Low Cost Water Quality Monitoring in Real-Time
 * Designed a low-cost IoT system to monitor water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and water level in real time.
 * Used sensors integrated with a microcontroller to collect data and transmit readings continuously for monitoring and analysis.
 * Implemented real-time data visualization using a cloud platform or dashboard for remote access and alerts.
 * Aimed to provide an affordable and efficient solution for monitoring drinking water, agriculture, and environmental water sources.
 
 **Tools:** *Personal Computer (laptop), Internet Connection/Wi-Fi, Arduino IDE, Sensors (pH, Temperature, Turbidity), LED Display, Embedded C code, Connecting Wires*

# 2. Basic Network Infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer
 * Designed a basic network infrastructure using router, switch, and end devices to understand real-world LAN setup.
 * Configured IP addressing, default gateway, and basic device connectivity within the simulated network.
 * Verified network communication using ping and simple troubleshooting techniques.
 * Gained hands-on practice with networking fundamentals and logical network design using Cisco Packet Tracer.

 **Tools:** *Cisco Packet Tracer, Routing, Switching, Troubleshooting, IP Configuring, VLAN, DNS, DHCP, HTTP/HTTPS*
